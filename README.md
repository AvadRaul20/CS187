# CS187

The following are all the project descriptions of the projects completed in the course CS187. This course was designed in order to introduce students to more complex ideas in Java by introducing the development of methods for designing and implementing abstract data type methods in Java. All the ideas covered are essential to using Java at higher levels in the future.

## Intro - Project 1
This project is intended to allow students to get a good grasp upon an IDE called VSCode. 

## RLE Encoding - Project 2
For this project, we executed Run Length Encoding, or RLE, a calculation that encodes ascii information in a compressed arrange. Given a content record containing an picture built with ascii characters, RLE will encode the record in compressed shape. Given a record with information in RLE compressed frame, we are able to decompress the record and recover the precise picture that was initially compressed. We utilized clusters as the fundamental information structures to execute the RLE compression and decompression algorithms.

## Bucket Sort - Project 3
In Java, this strategy is called “compareTo” within the Comparable interface. Any course that actualizes Comparable can be sorted since they can be compared. There are other sorting calculations that don't depend on comparing data directly. These are not general purpose within the sense that they ought to be customized for distinctive sorts of information. In this extend you'll actualize one of these sorting calculations called Bucket Sort. The adaptation of Bucket Sort will be customized to work with integrability, but it might work with any typical language.

## Linked Lists - Project 4
In this project, we typed in a linked-based usage for the List unique information sort, as indicated in ListInterface.java. You’ll be building a separately connected list that can act as a ramble course. The necessity is all strategies you execute must use recursion and you're NOT permitted to utilize any circle (such as for, whereas, do-while). You must moreover remain inside Big-O runtime bounds so that the rambles are productive in conveying life essentials.

## Postfix Evaluator - Project 5
For this task, you'll actualize an evaluator for postfix expressions. Your evaluator will be stack-based, and able of assessing accurately shaped but something else self-assertive arithmetic expressions on integrability. You may actualize the stack employing a connected list.

## Scapegoat Tree - Project 6
In this task, you’ll begin with a codebase for twofold look trees comparable to that displayed in address. You’ll ought to execute a few extra strategies for double search trees. At that point, you’ll subclass the double look tree to form a “scapegoat tree” — a straightforward frame of a self-balancing double look tree.

## Priority Queue - Project 7
In this project, we executed a cutting edge computerized crisis room (ER) triage framework. Your system will get information within the shape of understanding and harm sets over time and consequently dole out patients to specialists as the assets ended up accessible depending on the severity of the patient’s damage. To achieve this, you'll execute a information structure called a need line – more particularly, a heap-based need queue.

## Graph Coloring - Project 8
Numerous real-world issues can be spoken to by charts and unraveled by applying different calculations to the chart (GPS route, utility systems, social systems are fair a few of the frameworks that depend on charts). In this task, you may actualize a chart structure and a graph coloring calculation. You'll at that point utilize the chart and graph-coloring calculation to unravel different issues including strife resolution and finding an ideal task of assets to achieve a assignment or objective.
